### Tokenomics Evaluation Framework
_High level framework / key questions for evaluating tokenomics_

**Supply**

Key Question(s): Based on supply alone, will this token hold or increase it's value? Or will that be inflated away?

**Total Supply**
- How many tokens exist today?
- How many will ever exist? (e.g. is there a supply cap in place?)

**Issuance Rate**
- Is the issuance rate fixed or variable?
- If variable, what are the factors that determine (and can influence) issuance rates?

**Allocation/Vesting**
- How was the supply initially allocated among investors, community, core team, etc?
- Are there any holder(s) with a significant stake that could drive material selling pressure upon vesting?
- What is the vesting schedule for the largest holders?
